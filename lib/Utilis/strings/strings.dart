  static const String blackCoffee = "Black coffee, a classic and popular beverage, is crafted by combining freshly ground coffee beans with hot water, omitting any additives like milk or sugar. Prepared through methods such as drip brewing, pour-over, or espresso extraction, black coffee boasts a robust and intense flavor profile, showcasing the distinct characteristics of the chosen coffee beans. Its taste varies based on factors such as bean origin, roast level, and brewing technique. With a moderate caffeine content, black coffee provides a natural stimulant and is low in calories, offering potential health benefits such as antioxidants. Popular variations include the Americano and long black, both appreciated for their bold coffee experience. The key to a satisfying cup lies in using high-quality, freshly ground beans and mastering the brewing process to achieve the desired strength and flavor.";
  static const String espresso   = "Espresso, a concentrated coffee beverage originating from Italy, is created by forcing hot water through finely-ground coffee under high pressure. This process results in a small, strong shot of coffee with a layer of rich crema on top. Espresso is the base for various coffee drinks like cappuccinos, lattes, and Americanos. The coffee beans used for espresso are typically roasted to a darker degree, enhancing the robust and intense flavor profile. Serving sizes are small, usually around 1 ounce, providing a potent caffeine kick. Espresso is celebrated for its quick preparation and ability to capture the nuanced flavors of high-quality coffee beans, making it a cornerstone of many coffee enthusiasts' preferences.";
  static const String americano  = "The Americano is a popular coffee beverage that originated during World War II when American soldiers in Italy diluted their espresso shots with hot water to resemble the drip-brewed coffee they were accustomed to back home. To prepare an Americano, a shot of espresso is combined with varying amounts of hot water, adjusting the strength to personal preference. The result is a coffee resembling drip brew but with the distinct characteristics of espresso, including a crema layer. Americanos offer a milder flavor compared to straight espresso, and their strength can be customized by adjusting the water-to-espresso ratio. This versatile drink serves as a middle ground between the robustness of espresso and the lighter profile of drip coffee, appealing to a wide range of coffee enthusiasts.";
  static const String latte  = "A latte, short for caffè latte in Italian, is a popular and creamy espresso-based drink. It is made by combining a shot or two of espresso with steamed milk and a small amount of frothed milk on top. The term <latte> itself means milk in Italian, and this beverage is characterized by its smooth and velvety texture. Lattes allow for a customizable experience, with options for variations such as flavored syrups or additional ingredients like chocolate or caramel. The ratio of espresso to steamed milk can also be adjusted to suit personal taste preferences, resulting in a milder coffee flavor compared to a straight espresso. Lattes are often served in larger cup sizes, making them a popular choice for those who enjoy a creamier and less intense coffee experience.";
  static const String cappuccino  = "A cappuccino is a classic Italian espresso-based drink known for its balanced combination of espresso, steamed milk, and frothed milk. The traditional preparation involves equal parts of these three components, creating a beverage with a rich and velvety texture. Typically served in smaller cup sizes, cappuccinos have a strong coffee flavor from the espresso, complemented by the creamy and airy consistency provided by the steamed and frothed milk. The frothed milk, often forming a distinctive layer on top, adds a delightful touch to the drink. Cappuccinos are appreciated for their well-balanced and harmonious blend of coffee and milk, making them a popular choice for those who enjoy a satisfying and nuanced coffee experience.";
  static const String macchiato  = "A macchiato, derived from the Italian word meaning <stained> or <spotted>, is a coffee beverage characterized by a shot of espresso <stained> or marked with a small amount of frothy milk. There are variations of the macchiato, with the most common being the espresso macchiato and the caramel macchiato. In the traditional espresso macchiato, a shot of espresso is <stained> with a dollop of frothed milk, creating a strong coffee flavor with a subtle touch of creaminess. The caramel macchiato, on the other hand, typically features vanilla syrup, steamed milk, and espresso, with caramel drizzle on top. The macchiato offers a balance between the boldness of espresso and the texture of frothy milk, making it a favorite for those who appreciate a simple yet flavorful coffee experience.";
  static const String mocha  = "A mocha, short for <caffe mocha,> is a delightful and indulgent coffee beverage that combines espresso, steamed milk, and chocolate. This combination results in a rich and flavorful drink with a perfect blend of coffee and chocolate elements. The espresso provides a strong and bold coffee base, while the steamed milk adds a creamy texture. The chocolate component can come in various forms, including cocoa powder, chocolate syrup, or melted chocolate. Whipped cream is often added on top for an extra touch of indulgence. Mochas can be customized to suit individual preferences by adjusting the sweetness or chocolate intensity. This beverage is a popular choice for those who enjoy a fusion of coffee and chocolate flavors in a comforting and satisfying cup.";
  static const String flatWhite  = "A flat white is a coffee beverage that originated in Australia or New Zealand and is characterized by its balance of strong espresso and velvety microfoam. It is similar to a latte but has a higher coffee-to-milk ratio and a thinner layer of microfoam. To prepare a flat white, a shot or two of espresso is poured over steamed milk, creating a smooth and well-integrated drink. The key distinction is the microfoam, which is finely textured milk with tiny, velvety bubbles, providing a creamy consistency without the thick layer of froth found in a cappuccino. The result is a coffee with a strong and bold flavor from the espresso, complemented by the smoothness of the textured milk. Flat whites are appreciated for their simplicity and the emphasis on the quality of both the coffee and milk components.";
  static const String affogato  = "An affogato is a delightful Italian dessert or beverage that consists of a shot of hot espresso poured over a scoop of vanilla ice cream or gelato. The name <affogato> translates to <drowned> in Italian, capturing the essence of the preparation, as the hot espresso is poured over the cold ice cream, creating a delightful contrast in temperature and texture. The result is a harmonious combination of the rich and robust flavors of espresso blending with the sweet, creamy notes of the ice cream. Affogatos are often served in small bowls or glasses, making them a simple yet indulgent treat enjoyed for the interplay of hot and cold, bitter and sweet. Some variations may include toppings such as chocolate shavings or a drizzle of caramel for added decadence.";
